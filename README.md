# AWS Amazon S3: Bucket creation and objects Access Control using AWS CLI #

## Project Description

In this project, I explored the capabilities of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) by
creating an S3 bucket, uploading objects, and configuring permissions to make those objects
publicly accessible. Additionally, I used the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to list
bucket contents, demonstrating fundamental S3 operations.

This hands-on practice enhanced my understanding of cloud storage, object permissions, and
CLI-based AWS interactions.
